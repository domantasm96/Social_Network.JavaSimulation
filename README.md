# Preface

The aim of this programming project is to advance in the study of the design and implementation   of   data   structures   and   algorithms   throughout   the   course.   The development of the project will require, most probably, to rethink program designs and programming alternatives previously made, but those activities are considered part of course goals. All the design decisions made, the project management and the program code will be documented in a Project Report which will record all activities and tasks performed.

# Project structure

Documentation in pdf format is named "Report.pdf"

Uploaded with generated People, Friends, residential text files, they can modified and deleted if the code will be tested with the custom people, friends and residential databases.

Main project code is located in the "src" folder.

Some parts of the code have been commented to make it more readable and understandable.

Images that was used in the documentation can be found in the "Diagrams" folder.
